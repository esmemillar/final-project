The property includes almond, olive and cherry trees as well as an orchard, and has been certified biodynamic since 2015. Since then, they have been making a range of 6 authentic still wines, focusing on tradition, respect and simplicity. Fins Als Kullons it is a most irreverent natural red wine, breaking all the winemaking rules by mixing white and red varieties in the same wine. It comes from Demeter certified vineyards planted in limestone and clay soil, cultivated according to biodynamic practices in every phase. The harvest is carried out manually at the optimum moment of ripeness. In the winery, the Fins Als Kullons grapes are fermented separately in stainless steel tanks with native yeasts. Then they are put together in cement tanks for 9 months. Finally it is bottled without being filtered, refined or adding sulphites. Fins Als Kullons is the result of an unusual mixture of white and red varieties. A wine that looks both red and ros√© and is easy to drink on any occasion thanks to its lightness and freshness."
