    "bio": "Alice Bouvot is the proud proprietor of 5 hectares of vines in the Arbois region of the Jura. Alice started her domaine in 2005 with just 2 hectares and over the years have bought small plots and slowly increased their production. Some of our favorite winery visits are with Alice and her adorable sons. On top of her warmth, the vineyards are equally as vibrant. LOctavin is now Demeter biodynamic certified and she works to convey this message to the fullest. Wild grasses, weeds, insects, and animals all have a place in their vines creating a true ecosystem that gives a deeper meaning to each glass of her wine. Since 2009 all LOctavin wines are pur jus, with no additives whatsoever. The grapes are destemmed by hand and fermented without the use of SO2, cultured yeasts, or other additives. Most of the wines are fermented and aged in fiber glass or steel tanks, but only at the ambient temperature of the cave. Most of LOctavin wines are made to reflect single plot expression. The Don Giovanni, for instance, is from a very old plot of Pinot Noir with some old Chardonnay vines as well, so the two grapes come together in the cuvée."

    "bio": "SRC is a small family operation started in 2013 with five wines  from about 17 hectares of Contrada (sites) between Solicchiata and Randazzo  on the northern slopes of Mt. Etna in Sicily. The name comes from the first  initials of owners Rori and Cinzia, and their daughter Sandra. As a double  meaning, when you say the words SRC together, it sounds like the Italian  phrase 'essence' meaning: 'We are here.' The high elevation and steep slopes of  Etna are full of tiny plots of terraced vines, fueled by fresh and rejuvenated  volcanic soils that create truly one-of-a-kind grapes. The estate vines are in 5  distinct districts: Crasà, Calderara, Rivaggi, Barbabecchi, and Pirao; all of which  offer a unique quality to these biodynamically farmed indigenous varieties, with  management of wild herbs and the help of local sheep. In the cellar, natural and  slow fermentations, minimal intervention, large old barrels, and no sulfur use,  create a small range of inspiring and delicious Etna wine.",

Joe’s ethos is rooted in showcasing the unique cold climate terroirs of the Pacific Northwest using a hands off approach. Swick partners exclusively with organic and biodynamic growers to develop wines that he himself would like to drink -- fresh, lively acidity, with no conventional additives, only adding modest amounts of SO2 on select wines when absolutely necessary. Swick Wines integrate themselves into a movement looking to rewrite the history of West Coast winemaking. Joe uses a number of minimal intervention techniques from experimentation in skin-contact to field blends to Pét-Nats. Swick works with historically farmed regional varieties such as Pinot Noir, Chenin Blanc and Grenache and experiments with non-native grapes such as Verdelho, Melon de Bourgogne and Touriga Nacional. What ends up in the glass are energetic, vins de soif with a freshness and balanced acidity that reflect their artist, terroir, and space in time -- each year bringing new wines and a new approach. You never know what surprises you might find with Swick.",

The spirit and the untouched nature of this place has changed our lives forever.We started making wine just for ourselves, which is still to this day is inspired by the excitement of experimentation and the ways to discover the potential in the terroir that surrounds us. We don't use commercial yeast, we let the juice to ferment by its own yeast flora, which gives our wines a special, unique and distinct aroma. By the constant expelling of wine additives we can preserve the fruits original characteristics and the unique minerality of the volcanic soil. Our main goal is making natural wines in order to show the most of the terroir. We try to focus on exploring traditional Hungarian grape varieties and cultivate what is given by nature. Beside cultivating vineyards and making wine, we felt the need to provide accomodation for guests arriving to winetasting. When we bought the vineyards on the hillside, we also transformed the old summer houses into guesthouses.",

It was in 2017 that we bought this land, with the ambition of making it a place where life, sharing and joy would take over everything else. It was therefore natural for us to baptize this precious place with the same name as the coast that runs along it, the coast of joy. We have planted 37,000 “vitis vinifera” type vines in 3 years. The selection of grape varieties was made naturally, simply thinking about the grape varieties that we like to drink. Our instinct told us that these varieties would grow well on Joy hill, and indeed, it did not disappoint us! Our playground therefore consists of grüner veltliner, blaufränkisch, gamay, gamaret, melon de bourgogne, pinot blanc, riesling and chardonnay. Our soil is composed of sand, silt, clay and shale. It is a stony ground, filled with metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, which makes the happiness of the vines and their roots. It is a place where the sunsets are flamboyant and where nature is beautiful and generous.",

    "bio": "Marcel Lapierre took over the family domaine in 1973. The big event in his winemaking career, was his adoption of natural practices as preached by Jules Chavet, a chemist and researcher that fought against the introduction of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the 1950s. Lapierre, together with Guy Breton, Jean-Paul Thévenet, and Jean Foillard, worked together to establish a natural approach for wine in Beaujolais. In the face of a region whose wines had often been made for immediate consumption and enshrined with the Beaujolais nouveau campaigns, making natural wine without compromise was going against the grain. This group of vignerons called for a return to the old practices of viticulture and vinification: starting with old vines, never using synthetic herbicides or pesticides, harvesting late, rigorously sorting to remove all but the healthiest grapes, adding minimal doses of sulphur dioxide or none at all, and avoiding chaptalization whenever possible. Marcels mantle is now taken by his son Matthieu and his daughter Camille, who have introduced biodynamic farming to the domaine.",

He prefers not to add sulfur to his wines.

    "bio": "Paziols feels like a place frozen in time. Tucked away in the Pyrenees Mountains this village used to belong to the Principality of Catalonia and in many ways genuinely still boasts an almost medieval feel. Here the past still holds sway; standing in its age-old streets its hard not to imagine Templar Knights setting off on a Grail quest. Its among these buildings and cobblestone streets of a bygone era you’ll find the visionary vigneron Sébastien Agelet and his passion project De Mena. Paziols is small, so small that the first person two clearly lost Americans ran into was the Aunt of the exact person they were looking for. Though lucky, I feel anyone in the village could have led us to Sébastien. Although the area is surrounded by vines there are actually very few wineries in the town. Most growers in the area tend to sell their wines to the co-op, something Sébastien and his family had historically done as well. Not too long ago though something changed, Sébastien began to feel there was a better way, in essence a more natural and organic way. He began to farm his family’s old vine vineyards organically and pull more and more fruit away from the co-op and devote it to his own winemaking techniques, and thus De Mena (Catalan for “By Nature”) was born. We have tasted a lot of “Natural Wines” good, bad, and everywhere in between, and we can honestly say only a handful have had a visceral effect, and De Mena is certainly one. De Mena is about a purpose and a passion. So many times, the “Natural Wine” movement, of which we are firm believers, can get caught up in hype and marketing. De Mena has great labels, no denying that, but as anyone who has had the wines can attest these are more than legit, they are purposeful, thought provoking, important, and maybe most significant utterly delicious!",

    "bio": "The estate was created in 1982, and although it was very much avant-garde in its farming straightaway (biodynamic since 1985), Christoph Beau was seen as young and crazy for preferring to optimise the natural process, relying on his intuition and conviction rather than scientific measures. In 2010 Victor, Christoph's son, took over after a short career in physiotherapy, and now runs the 8ha estate. Victor feels priviliged to be working with vineyards with some of the most interesting terroir in the famed appellation. Surrounded by limestone cliffs, with soils that are rich in gravette de Corconne - big limestone sediments that help to retain freshness during the long summer days. He is very thankful for the knowledge and the 'bon sens paysan' passed down from his father. Today, Victor makes the wines with a good family friend Herve, a teacher at the Arts et Metiers ParisTech, but also one of the first natural wine distributors in Paris. Victor, following his father's path, leads the farming work, while Herve follows the same philosophy in the cellar. The duo like to keep an outsider's eye on each other and are constantly challenging themselves. As Victor's dad often says wisely, we are easily trapped by fame and the name on the label, while forgetting that the mission is to look after and cherish the land. Today, in Victor and Herves hands, the farming and the wines are as ‘avant-garde’ as Domaine Inebriati has ever been, and we are looking forward to seeing what the upcoming vintages will bring as they will start experimenting with amphoras directly burried in the vineyards.",

Over time, plantations and the acquisition of several additional parcels brought the vineyard to its current size of 26 hectares. Maxime-François, one of the couples three children, joined the estate in 2006 and has accompanied them in applying the tenets of biodynamic viticulture to the vineyard (today certified organic by Ecocert and biodynamic by Demeter) and in the estate’s completely natural vinifications.

In 1994, she joined the Repaire de Bacchus, a chain of Parisian wine stores. It was in 1998 that Ariane worked her first harvest in Burgundy and led her to complete her training with a Professional Patent Manager Farmer, with the goal of one day managing her own domain. She stayed in Burgundy for six years, where she had the chance to work with one of the seminal (now certified biodynamic) domaines in Nuits St. Georges, Domaine de l Arlot. In the mid-2000s, Ariane went to Great Britain to work for an English wine merchant who introduced her to the world of fine wine speculation, but in 2008, she returned to Paris to take up the trade of wine merchant. It was here that she was first immersed in the world of organic, biodynamic, and natural wines which fueled her desire to return to the land. During this time she was falling under the spell of pineau d aunis, specifically the 2005 vintage of Domaine de Montrieux Rouge, which reminded her of the texture of the pinot noir that she loved so much but with an added aromatic side typical of the grape variety. This was the spark that then led to a deeper interest in the region the variety is grown — that is in and around Touraine and Anjou — and a quest to taste all the wines made from it. After a few years of exploration, it was settled that this is where she was going to live. In the beginning of 2014, Ariane learned that Emile Héredia, the owner of Domaine de Montrieux in the Côteaux du Vendômois, would be selling the estate. She did not think twice about it, and by harvest time she was living on the estate, ultimately taking over by the spring of 2015. When she first took the reins, the property was planted to 7.5 hectares, but after two years of losses (2016 loss of 60% and 2017 loss of 40%), she decided to uproot some vines to replant in a better-suited parcel in 2018. Now, the estate has a little over 6 hectares of vines planted with pineau d aunis, gamay teinturiers, chenin blanc, pinot blanc, pinot noir, and cabernet franc. In 2017 Ariane decided to begin a small negoce project to supplement her production in lean years, as many in the Loire had to do after a string of trying vintages.",
